            <h3>An Exciting New Job</h3>
            <p>I started working for the Halifax Regional Municipality back in 2016 as an apprentice electrician. I loved worked with the public and was so excited to begin a new career, it seemed like everything I wanted it to be until...</p>

            <h3>The Realization</h3>
            <p>I was working outside in the cold of a maritime winter, standing on a ladder during a blizzard changing a light outside of an abandoned building. I got back into my work van and checked my phone and saw a picture of my brother working ona  website in front of a roaring fireplace.</p>

            <h3>The Change</h3>
            <p>I promptly returned home from work, with a desire for change urging me onwards. As soon as my fingers defrosted I was on the NSCC website applying for the IT Programming course. I had one year left of my apprenticeship which would give me plenty of time to figure things out, or so I thought...</p>

            <h3>The Pandemic</h3>
            <p>2020 was about to throw a wrench into my plans. I went into work only to find out my department was getting cut. I was laid off and a bit dejected upon returning home. The world was scary and still trying to come to terms with what was happening. I was beginning to wonder where I would work next, when the best news arrived to my house!</p>

            <h3>The News</h3>
            <p>I could hardly contain my excitement gripping the acceptance letter in my hand. This was exactly the change I hoped for. I had been testing out some development methods with my brother as a guide and I just <span class="emphasis">knew</span> this was the best path for me. I could barely wait until September hit.</p>

            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>I had a blast learning to code for two years. It was so fun, creative, and rewarding. I loved how the code pieces fit together like puzzles. Even when it got hard, I was always into it. And guess what? After school finished, I aced a couple of interviews and got my first job!</p>

            <h3>The Last Two Years</h3>
            <p>I have spent the last two years working at Resulta doing web development. It has been such an amazing time, and I have learned so much and met so many people. Unfortunately do to restructing I was caught up in the most recent layoffs. While it was sad news that I would no longer be working with such an amazing group of people I am <span class="emphasis"> very</span>excited for my next adventure to start. I hope you had fun learning a little bit about me and my journey to get me here!</p>
